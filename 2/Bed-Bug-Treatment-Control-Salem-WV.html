<p>A redirection of pest management is required to incorporate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to think about the results of these practices on the overall fauna, dietary state, and balance of local communities (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to explain a methodical technique of managing pests using non-chemical pest management techniques and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations go beyond appropriate levels.</p>
<p>In the pest control stories, the children found out that farmers utilize ladybirds to eliminate aphids on their crops, and that a big weed-eating undersea mammal (the manatee) is utilized by river authorities to keep waterways clear for boats.
