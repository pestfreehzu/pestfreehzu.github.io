<p>Because the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical market to imply essentially anything a practitioner desires it to imply, Beyond Pesticides has actually embraced the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus practitioners require to have -stressing the wider ecology of pest management and avoiding toxic chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our service technicians check your homes for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management professionals can use video to record and narrate examinations and leave a copy for the center manager through e-mail, or conduct a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are unable to be present at their center during the examination.</p>
<p>Therefore, pest management practices on one crop can straight or indirectly affect the other. Pest control is major business, one that you should not be handling yourself.
