<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them precisely, so that suitable control decisions can be made in combination with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the major pattern has actually been towards using modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace traditional pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these methods are still therapeutics.</p>
<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound methods as well as its array of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
