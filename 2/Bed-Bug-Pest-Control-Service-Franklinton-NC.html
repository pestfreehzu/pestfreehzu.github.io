<p>Current research studies record the need for continued decreases in harmful pesticide usage and practices. Although the fundamental components of IPM are constantly the exact same, the specific elements of an IPM program vary from one environment or situation to another. When done prior to spacing the plants, application of predatory termites versus thrips in potted plants is more efficient.</p>
