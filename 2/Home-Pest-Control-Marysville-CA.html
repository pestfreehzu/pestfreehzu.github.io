<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be substantial obstacle to the growth of your business. However, some practitioners translate IPM as turning chemicals from various mode of action groups to preserve pest control efficacy and lower pesticide resistance with an emphasis on minimizing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized versus certain soil pests, bacteria, and viruses against pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungis work against a variety of pests.</p>
