You will lower the chance of damaging your health if you reduce your direct exposure and take care when you come into contact with pesticides. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort. Integrated pest management was conceived during the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget impacts, and economic waste were plainly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>The various contributors involved in the value chain of the insect pest control market consist of basic material suppliers, R&D institutes, insect pest control services making companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and government bodies & regulative associations such as the Epa (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating disruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).
