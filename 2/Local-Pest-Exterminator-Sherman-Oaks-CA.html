CHEMICAL CONTROL OF BUG PEST: Use of synthetic chemicals for managing pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals used for this are called insecticides.</p>
<p>Biological pest control measures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to establish acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions.

<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest issues, classical biological control method is normally utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
