<p>Below ground termites live underground and develop tunnels, also referred to as mud tubes", to reach food sources. The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a duration of about ten years, primarily amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are frequently monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which creates a homogenous habitat typically lacking crucial requirements of natural opponents, therefore preferring pest species.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active function in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
