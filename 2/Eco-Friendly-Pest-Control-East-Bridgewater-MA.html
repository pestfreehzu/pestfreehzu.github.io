<h3>Cockroach Prevention East Bridgewater Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
