<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home pest pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>If a pest or disease causes inappropriate damage in spite of preventative efforts, pick a reliable management technique that will have the least quantity of effect on other living animals and the environment.
