Some scientists likewise acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might take place, even yearly management of a continuous pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a combination of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the increase of pest control.</p>
