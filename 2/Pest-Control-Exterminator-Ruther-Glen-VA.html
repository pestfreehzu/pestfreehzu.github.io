<p>Pest Management fact sheets Information on arthropod pest abundance, location within the greenhouse, and population trends (increases, decreases, or stable) help figure out the effectiveness of pest management methods. IPM methods consist of the introduction of predators and specific parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects).

<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and recognize them precisely, so that appropriate control choices can be made in conjunction with action limits. However, the major pattern has been towards the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to change standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these methods are still therapeutics.</p>
<p>The human action depends upon the significance of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eliminate the pest. Recent experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for key examples in the discussion.
