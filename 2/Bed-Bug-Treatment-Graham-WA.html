<p>Unfortunately, the higher Tampa Bay location is home to a lot of spiders, and you have actually most likely stumbled upon them inside your home. Think about alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Recent quests for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward advancement of brand-new and much better products with which to replace standard poisonous pesticides.</p>
