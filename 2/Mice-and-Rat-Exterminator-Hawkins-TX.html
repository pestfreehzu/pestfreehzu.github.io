<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are attracted to a number of locations that can offer any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3. If much of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be utilized as the last option, in concept, sometimes they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or invasive pests and illness or to protect the seed and transplants from typical and persistent pest problems.</p>
<p>The complete expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the very first time, 28 years back (Kogan 1998).

If further tracking, identifications and action limits show that less dangerous controls are not working, then extra pest control techniques would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Nevertheless excellent the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is just fair to state that worldwide, its release in agriculture is still in its infancy, and we are a long method from understanding whatever that goes on around the crops we grow for food.</p>
