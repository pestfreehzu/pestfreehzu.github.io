<p>This information, in combination with available pest control approaches, is utilized to manage pest damage by the most affordable means, and with the minimal risk to people, property, and the environment.

<p>Kaolin particle movies used in organic farming might control some pests, but can negatively impact natural opponents and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ).
