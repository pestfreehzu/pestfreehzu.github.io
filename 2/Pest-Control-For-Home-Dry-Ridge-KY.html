IPM programmes initial job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed.

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>
