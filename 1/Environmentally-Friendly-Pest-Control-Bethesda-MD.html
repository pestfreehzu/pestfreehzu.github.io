<p>Think about alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily towards advancement of brand-new and better products with which to replace standard toxic pesticides.</p>
<p>An extensive understanding of basic IPM concepts and various management choices for all possible pest issues is very important as some are preventive and others are curative.

For instance, feeding activities of particular caterpillars on the leaves of potatoes and tomatoes cause a systemic production of protease inhibitors expressed throughout the plant that disrupt the digestion procedure and feeding habits of insects (36 ).</p>
<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest.
