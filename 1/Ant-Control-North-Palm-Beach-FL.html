<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and reduce danger from pests and pest management tools and strategies in such a way that reduces general financial, health, and environmental threats.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses a number of the same ideas as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
<p>By completing and making use of an IPM strategy, members may be able to save cash on pest control techniques which were previously used and can potentially minimize future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Most of insecticides fall under the chemical category due to the fact that they are generally more reliable and can normally be utilized to control a number of pests. Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can exclude pests and lower the damage they inflict.</p>
