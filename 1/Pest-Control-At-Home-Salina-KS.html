With more regulations on pesticide use and a decrease in the variety of active ingredients in some crops, there is a greater focus on better understanding of readily available control options (Hillocks 2012 ).

Some require long-term contracts that cost $400 or more although for a lot of pests, a single treatment done well need to be sufficient. Once the committee comprehends the kinds of pests that might enter the building and potentially damage collection products, the next step is to establish an IPPM program to resolve the determined needs.</p>
