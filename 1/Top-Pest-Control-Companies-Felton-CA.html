To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life cycle, host range, distribution, motion, and basic biology will have to be researched.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest advantages of natural techniques is that they don't include the use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not kill the advantageous insects.
