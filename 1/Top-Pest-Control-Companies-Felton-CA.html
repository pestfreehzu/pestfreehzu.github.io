The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers.

We have actually been in business since 1947, which means we understand the pests that are common to this region and have the knowledge and tools to remove them. To deplore an effective IPM programme, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life cycle, host range, distribution, motion, and basic biology will have to be researched.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest advantages of natural techniques is that they don't include the use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not kill the advantageous insects.
