<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are enormous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not mix pesticides. There are 4 major components in the brand-new IPM model that deal with numerous pest management choices, the knowledge, and resources the grower needs to deal with the pest concern, preparation and company of details to take suitable management actions, and keeping excellent interaction to disseminate and get understanding about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Tolerate the helpful insects and a few of the pest insects that they need for food.
