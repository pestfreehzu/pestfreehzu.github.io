<p>The series of pests found in food processing plants will vary according to food, location and environment active ingredients processed, however the most typical ones are beetles, moths, rodents, cockroaches, and flies.

Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance. </p>
