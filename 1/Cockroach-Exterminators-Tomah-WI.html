<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about ten years, generally among researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are frequently monocultures, including a single crop species, which creates a homogenous environment typically lacking essential requirements of natural enemies, therefore preferring pest species.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine inspections. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a legitimate step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the increase of pest control.</p>

After carrying out any pest management method, check the indicator plants to assess if arthropod pests have been eliminated and assess the efficiency and durability of control.</p>
