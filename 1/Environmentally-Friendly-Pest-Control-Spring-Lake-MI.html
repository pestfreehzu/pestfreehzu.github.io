<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for managing pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily eliminate the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and additional feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very important measure owing to the fact that a variety of pests are carriers of damaging disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing new to pest control-- pest control specialists often use scents traps as a way to keep an eye on pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack away from the crop.
