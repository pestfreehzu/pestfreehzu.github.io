This method describes making use of a range of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in some cases comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Before signing a contract for pest control, you ought to be clear about the price being paid, the services being covered and the existence of cancellation charges, Anti-Pesto says. You can use traps to catch specific pests, and barriers to secure plants from insect attack or disease infection. Along the continuum, extra non-chemical tactics such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop varieties, mating interruption, sterile insect release, and so on, may be incorporated into the system.</p>
