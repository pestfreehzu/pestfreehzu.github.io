<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and planned management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low ecological impact. Expert exterminators utilize different kinds of pesticides and baits to eliminate and get rid of pests. Efficient, long-term corrective actions can then be taken to avoid pests from going into the structure and infesting the building and collections. </p>
