<p>Problems with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or a minimum of consideration for its adoption at the nationwide or local level in the majority of countries, and in many it has actually become main governmental policy. Making use of chemical representatives to deal with either regular pest mitigation or more entrenched infestations should be delegated expert pest management companies who are trained and accredited in accordance with state policies and health and safety requirements.</p>

<p>Normally, the primary goal of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to incorporate diseases, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of sites such as commercial and residential structures, yard and grass locations, and house and community gardens.</p>
