<p>The advantages of Integrated Pest Management are enormous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes making use of living organisms to control a pest population.

<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so intolerable sometimes that the only option left is to employ a local pest control company to remove pests.

Thus, integrated pest management indicates that areawide and long-lasting methods can be valuable.</p>
<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all strategies.
