There are various techniques to control the insect pests.

Due to any variety of reasons, consisting of those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural sections, compromising the efficiency of natural opponents often allows prospective pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population development and allows them to reach pest status. </p>
