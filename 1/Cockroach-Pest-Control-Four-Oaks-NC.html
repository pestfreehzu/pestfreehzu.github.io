The Rentokil commissioned Centre for Economics and Business Research Study (Cebr) report reveals the most costly and disruptive pest risks dealt with by food processors.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can just do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>Although Orkin has less pests in its recognizing library than other services, it is one of the best pest control companies readily available.
