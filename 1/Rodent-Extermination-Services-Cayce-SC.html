<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after regular tracking indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the cost of the control steps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies much of the exact same concepts as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all techniques. This chapter goes over various methods to keep pest insects at bearable levels or in other words incorporated pest management (IPM).
