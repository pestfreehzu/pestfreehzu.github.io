<p>The course will focus on the environmental and management concepts of pest control and you will learn to examine the consequences of pesticide use and application on the biological target. The United States EPA Biopesticides page contains better details. Adoption of IPM can be seen under a continuum, starting with systems mainly restricted to using a single tactical technique such as using financial thresholds for better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses much of the same ideas as IPM however restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>We provide quick, efficient and safe pest control services.
