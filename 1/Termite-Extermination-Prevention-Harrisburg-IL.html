If many of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be utilized as the last hope, in principle, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to secure the seed and transplants from typical and consistent pest issues.</p>
<p>Considering that IPM programme applies the most cost-effective management pest techniques, success is guaranteed for the grower or farmer.
