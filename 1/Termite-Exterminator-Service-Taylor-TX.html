Integrated pest management (IPM) is a system of safeguarding crops that fulfills the requirements of sustainable advancement by allowing farmers to handle pests in a way that is affordable, ecologically sound and appropriate to adopt under local conditions.</p>
<p>There are various pest management tactics to suppress pests. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making procedure for handling pests in an efficient, ecologically sound and affordable method. Although particular crop production and protection strategies are considered proprietary information, sharing knowledge and resources with each other will enhance pest control efficacy and benefit the whole grower community.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a lot of the exact same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>
<p>Kaolin particle movies utilized in organic farming might control some pests, but can adversely impact natural enemies and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural enemy populations, however a greater number of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
