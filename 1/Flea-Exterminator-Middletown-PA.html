Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines different kinds of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional artificial pesticides-- in a practical, long-term plan. Biopesticides are generally suitable with natural opponents, but there are exceptions.</p>

The term Integrated Preventive Pest Management (IPPM) much better shows this understanding. Prior to carrying out any pest management technique, select and tag (or flag) the leaves or stems of 1-5 infested plants per 1,000 ft2.</p>
