<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable method that incorporates practices for the financial avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Unique safety measures must be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic method to pest control.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Using helpful animals such as insects or fungis that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is put on how natural opponents function and how we can promote their natural efficiency. Consider soil or substrate health not just in the biological sense: minimal existence of soil borne pests or illness. Our incorporated pest management options are understood for providing safe, reliable and lasting results.</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in current years given that fire eliminates helpful insects along with the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To decrease possible damage to helpful insects, limit your spraying to small locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a number of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
